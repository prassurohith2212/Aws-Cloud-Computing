## 1.1. IAM: Users & Groups:

- IAM = Identity & Access Management, Global Service.
- Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.
- users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.
- Groups only contain users, not other groups.

# 1.2. IAM: Permissions:

- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies define the permissions of the users.
- In Aws you apply the least privilege principle: dont give more permissions than a user needs

### Example:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "rds:*",
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:rds:region:*:*"]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["rds:Describe*"],
            "Resource": ["*"]
        }
    ]
}
